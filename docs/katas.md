# Katas

Welcome! Katas arrive here as we publish them. Each kata ships with:

- A short brief (`README.md`)
- Starter code in `starter/`
- Tests in `tests/` (**your green bar**)
- Optional notebook (`.ipynb` or Jupytext `.py`) for demos

> When katas land, this page will list them in order with difficulty tags.
